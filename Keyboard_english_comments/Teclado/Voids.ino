      numberTyped or insideNewPasswordMenu are True, then we will change the
      value of some variables with the purpose of going back to main menu 
      cancelling all performed actions, and avoiding getting into password
      change menu.
      * We set cancelled as true. This way we won't get into the last 
        conditional, which checks if the entered password matchs the password 
        stored inside password[]. We don't need it to be checked because *
        button is used as cancel action / password change menu request.
      * We set mainMenuVariable as HIGH again to avoid getting into password
        change menu, since it depends on a conditional if (mainMenuVariable = low).
      * We set insideNewPasswordMenu as false. This variable is set to true when 
        we get in the new password menu, in order to be able to set an scenario where
        the code can know when we are inside new password menu or not. If we are 
        inside new password menú, this variable will be true, so if we press * button
        it means that we want to go back to main menu.
     Finally, we break the main while loop of this void, leaving directly the whole void, and 
     starting again the main loop of the code.
    - If previous conditional is not met, then it means that numberTyped and 
      insideNewPasswordMenu are false, so we still didn't press any number, and we are
      not inside new password menu, so if * key is pressed, it means that we request 
      the code to take us to new password Menu. In this situation we don't change back
      mainMenuVariable's value, we set cancelled as true to avoid getting into the last 
      conditional which checks if the typed password matchs the password 
      stored inside password[], and we break the main while loop of this void. This way,
      mainMenuVariable's value is still LOW once the main loop checks if the new password 
      menu conditional is true or not, and, since this conditional is 
      if (mainMenuVariable == LOW), we will get inside of it.
    If none of these two conditionals is met, then we will call mainKeyCaptation(array1, 
    array2);, which was explained previously, which will set keyDetected as true if a key
    was pressed. After it we will get its vaule and if it is true, we will get inside
    next conditional. Once we are inside next conditional we will perform some actions:
    - We set numberTyped as true so, from now, if we press * key, code will understand that
      we pressed a key and we need to cancel any action performed, so it will take us to 
      main code loop according to the first conditional explained previously.
    - We set keyDetected back to false, this way we won´t get inside this conditional until
      we press another key.
    - We change orang pin to output for 300 milliseconds, and we change it back to input, to 
      light up orange LED for that time showing to the user that a key was pressed.
    - We use newPasswordCounter as the position inside inputPassword[] array, where we will 
      store the value returned by getKeyPressedValue() void. This way, if we pressed the key 
      number 4 as the third number in our password, we will store in the inputPassword[] array
      in the third position the number 4.
    - Finally we newPasswordCounter++ to be able to record the number in the next position of
      the password.

       lead to burning in eeprom memory undesired and unknown passwords. While the light is 
       on, the code won't key new keys pressed.
     - We save in the position newPasswordCounte in the array password[], the last key 
       pressed.
