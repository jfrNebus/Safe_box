  load the confirmation void, and then the openClose void. Confirmation menu will check if what we typed is equal to
  actual value of Eeprom memory, and if so, it will set match = true. openClose void will either send a high pulse
  through A1 to the gate of mosfet and will trigger a green led for 2 seconds; or it will blink twice red light if
  password typed was wrong.
  In the other hand we have the new password menu. If mainMenuVariable == LOW, we get in this menu. This means that
  confirmation menu was loaded at least once, and it detected that * key was pressed. Since * was pressed,
  mainMenuVariable changed from HIGH to LOW. Once inside this conditional we will start by turning on the red LED constantly
  till we leave this menu to help the user to know which part of the code is being executed all the time. Then we send
  a message to serial monitor, and we set insideNewPasswordMenu as true, and mainMenuVariable to HIGH again. We will talk
  deeply about insideNewPasswordMenu variable, in newPassword void.
  We set mainMenuVariable again to HIGH because that way, if we leave the new password menu, we wont get again
  inside this menu, we will get just in the main loop. Then, orange led blinks 2, visual purpose only.
  New password menu will request the actual password with confirmation void. Confirmation void will set match to true or
  false. After loading confirmation void, and if insideNewPassWord is still true, (it can change during confirmation
  void), we load newPassword void. Once this void is over, we set red LED as input, and we leave new password menu.
