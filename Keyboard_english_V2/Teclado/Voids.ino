    - If mainMenuVariable is equals to low, and at the same time, variable
      numberTyped or insideNewPasswordMenu are True, then we will change the
      value of some variables with the purpose of going back to main menu 
      cancelling all performed actions, and avoiding getting into password
      change menu.
      * We set cancelled as true. This way we won't get into the last 
        conditional, which checks if the entered password matchs the password 
        stored inside password[]. We don't need it to be checked because *
        button is used as cancel action / password change menu request.
      * We set mainMenuVariable as HIGH again to avoid getting into password
        change menu, since it depends on a conditional if (mainMenuVariable = low).
      * We set insideNewPasswordMenu as false. This variable is set to true when 
        we get in the new password menu. If we press * button while being in the 
        new password menu, it means that we want to go back to main menu, and therefor
        we skip the "if (insideNewPasswordMenu)" conditional that comes next to
        confirmation.
     Finally, we break the main while loop of this void, leaving directly the whole void, 
     and starting again the main loop of the code.
    - If previous conditional is not met, then it means that numberTyped and 
      insideNewPasswordMenu are false, so we still didn't press any number, and we are
      not inside new password menu. So, if * key is pressed, it means that we request 
      the code to take us to new password Menu. In this situation, mainMenuVariable keeps 
      its new low value, we set cancelled as true to avoid getting into the last conditional
      which checks if the typed password matchs the password stored inside password[], and we 
      break the main while loop of this void. This way, mainMenuVariable's value is still 
      LOW once the main loop checks if the new password menu conditional is true or not. 
      Since this conditional is if (mainMenuVariable == LOW), we will get inside of it.
    If none of these two conditionals is met, then we will call mainKeyCaptation(array1, 
    array2);, which was explained previously. This method will set keyDetected as true, if a
    key was pressed. In case keyDetecte is equals to true, we will get inside
    next conditional, where some actions will be performed:
    - We set numberTyped as true. From now on, if we press * key, code will understand that
      we pressed a key and we need to cancel any action performed. In such stage, it will take 
      us to main code loop according to the first conditional explained previously.
    - We set keyDetected back to false, this way we wonÂ´t get inside this conditional until
      we press another key.
    - We change orang pin to output for 300 milliseconds, and we change it back to input. This
      will turn on the LED for that time, showing to the user that a key was pressed.
    - We use newPasswordCounter as the position inside inputPassword[] array, where we will 
      store the value returned by getKeyPressedValue() void. This way, if we pressed the key 
      number 4 as the third number in our password, we will store in the inputPassword[] array
      in the third position the number 4.
    - Finally we newPasswordCounter++ to be able to record the number in the next position of
      the password. Let's keep in mind that this variable is also used to control when the 
      while loop of this method must stop.
