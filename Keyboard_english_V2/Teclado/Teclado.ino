  menu or not. If this variable is equals to low, then we get in the menu to change password, otherwise we will just
  load the confirmation void, and then the openClose void. Confirmation menu will check if what we typed is equal to
  actual value of Eeprom memory. If both passwords are equals, it will set match = true. openClose void will either send 
  a high pulse through A1 to the gate of mosfet and will trigger a green led for 2 seconds; or it will blink twice red 
  light if password typed was wrong, according to the value of "match" variable set by "confirmation".
  In the other hand we have the new password menu. If mainMenuVariable == LOW, we get in this menu. This means that
  confirmation menu was loaded at least once, and it detected that * key was pressed. Since * was pressed, mainMenuVariable
  changed from HIGH to LOW. Once inside this conditional, we will start by turning on the red LED constantly till we leave
  this menu. This it meant to help the user to know which part of the code is being executed all the time. Then we send
  a message to serial monitor, we set insideNewPasswordMenu as true, and mainMenuVariable to HIGH again. We will
  talk deeply about insideNewPasswordMenu variable, in newPassword void.
  We set mainMenuVariable again to HIGH because that way, if we leave the new password menu, we wont get again
  inside this menu, we will get just in the main loop. Then, orange led blinks 2, visual purpose only.
  In order to reach the "newPassword" void, a right password must be registered by "confirmation". Confirmation void will 
  set match to true or false. After loading confirmation void, and if insideNewPasswordMenu is still true, (it can change during
  confirmation void), we load newPassword void. Once this void is over, we set red LED as input, and we leave new password menu.
