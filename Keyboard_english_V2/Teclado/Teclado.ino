  actual value of Eeprom memory. If both passwords are equals, it will set match = true. openClose, according to the value 
  of "match" variable set by "confirmation" void, will send a high pulse through A1 to the gate of mosfet and will trigger
  a green led for 2 seconds; or red LED will blink twice if the password typed was wrong.

  confirmation menu was loaded at least once, and it detected that * key was pressed. Since * was pressed, mainMenuVariable
  changed from HIGH to LOW. Once inside this conditional, we will start by turning on the red LED constantly till we leave
  this menu. This is meant to help the user to know which part of the code is being executed all the time. Then we send
  a message to serial monitor and we set insideNewPasswordMenu as true. Orange led blinks 2, visual purpose only.
  In order to reach the "newPassword" void, a right password must be registered by "confirmation". Confirmation void will 
  set match to true or false. After loading confirmation void, and if insideNewPasswordMenu is still true, (it can change during
  confirmation void), we load newPassword void. Once this void is over, we turn off red LED, and we leave new password menu.
